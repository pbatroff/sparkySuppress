# Host specifier is only required for Enterprise service, or SparkPost EU
#Host = demo.api.e.sparkpost.com

# Optional. What properties to put in files retrieved from SparkPost. Useful to keep file sizes down if you don't need all fields.
# If omitted, defaults to recipient, type, description.
#Properties = recipient,type,source,description,created,updated,subaccount_id

# Optional. Timezone that from_time and to_time retrieve queries apply to.  If omitted, defaults to UTC.
#Timezone = Europe/London

# Optional.  If omitted, defaults to 10000 for updates and retrieves. Lower number means make more, smaller-sized, API requests.
#BatchSize = 10000

# Optional, if omitted defaults to 10. Number of parallel threads to run on Deletes.
# Because Delete API is one-at-a-time, runs faster with more threads/http sessions.
# Increase with caution, too many threads can stress your host, and will likely cause rate-limiting from SparkPost, which
# defeats the object of going faster!
#DeleteThreads = 10

# Optional. Work within a subaccount.  If omitted, defaults to the master account (=0).
#Subaccount = 2

# Optional. File encodings used for reading your file during check/update/delete/retrieve.
# Default value is utf-8. You can give a list of encodings to try, the tool will try each in turn until the file
# reads properly.
# If your file fails to read, check possible values to use on: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
# For hints, see also: http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/text_file_processing.html
#
# For retrieve, the first encoding in the list is used to write the file.
FileCharacterEncodings=utf-8,utf-16,ascii,latin-1

# Optional. When updating with basic lists of email addresses that lack flags, apply the following default type.
# if omitted, non_transactional will be used.
TypeDefault = non_transactional

# Optional. Add the following description to your imports.
DescriptionDefault = sparkySuppress import

# Optional. Tune the snooze time used when 429 rate-limiting replies received. If omitted, defaults to 10 seconds.
# SnoozeTime = 2
